## Inspiration
As a small music artist or podcast host, it can be difficult to get your music out there. People who want to be singers, podcasters, or radio show hosts generally face a high barrier of entry for breaking into the industry. Live radio is becoming less and less common in the modern age as various streaming apps have replaced it. However, millions of people love listening to music/podcasts, and watching live streams, with a major feature being the live chat and social connection.

## What it does
We have built a solution to bring radio into the modern age with echosphere, an interactive livestreaming radio station platform. Our app aims to give creators an accessible platform to broadcast their own customizable radio show, to hone their radio hosting skills or share music. Users can tune into stations based on their listening preferences and be able to interact with the host and other listeners through live chatting, similar to a conventional video livestream.
